# A 3D model of roads underground
The repository contains various scripts and a database-structure used to create a 3D model of the roads in Griffiersveld in Apeldoorn. The 3D model is created to make circular renovation and maintenance of the roads possible.

This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 821033 (https://doi.org/10.3030/821033)
